# Track Explorer

This is a simple music recommendation system built with Python and Streamlit. The app provides similar track or artist recommendations
based on user input using Spotipy and Spotify API.

# Installation

  1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
  2. Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repo
  3. Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
  4. Run the app: streamlit run app.py

# Usage
After running the app, you should see a sidebar on the right with the option to get track or artist recommendations. Simply
enter the name of the artist/track you want to find similar music to, and the app will display the recommendations on the screen.
